# Talkdesk Dialpad

Talkdesk is about making and receiving calls. Once a User (also known as an Agent, an Admin or a Supervisor) has signed up for Talkdesk and has created their own account, they will then buy a new phone number. Using this number, the user is able to make & receive phone calls.

For this challenge we would like you to build the new Dialpad with an improved experience both in terms of usability and visual interface.

## Requirements
Web development is an area in which you have to keep up with the latest technologies and techniques, we want to see how you structure and organize your project, code and how you apply semantic meaning to it.

## Use Case
- As an agent, I want to be able to expand the Dialpad, select an Outbound number, choose an country code and add or type a phone number to place the call.

## Let´s start
- You will build a project based on a mockup designed by the UI/UX team in Sketch: [link](/problems/assets/dialpad/talkdeskdialpad.sketch) and also an example [here](/problems/assets/dialpad/example.pdf).
- Using the latest technologies, build the project (host it on a GitHub Repository) using HTML, CSS or any other language (like Javascript, React, etc.).
- The project must be built on the SaSS processor. Think of it as a framework where all elements and components might be used in other sections of your project.
- You can use any methodology and nomenclature that might help us create reusable components and code.
- Don’t forget to document your architecture and decisions in the `README.md`.

## Other Requirements
- As a bonus you can create interactions, behaviours and other components you think that will add value to the project.

## Background Information

Taking this into consideration, present us a solution that includes the process and methodology that you used to solve this problem.

*Final note*: If there's anything you don't understand or is ambiguous, open an issue in your repository with the question ;)

*Please understand that the purpose of this challenge is only to evaluate your technical abilities and none of your work will be used by Talkdesk by any means.*:
