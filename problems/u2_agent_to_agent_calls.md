# Agent to Agent Calls

Talkdesk currently allows users to make and receive calls directly from the browser. When they sign in to Talkdesk there is a "call bar" that allows them to call other contacts. They can do it directly from the Talkdesk profile or use the keypad to dial a phone number directly.

Typically, a company has several agents making and receiving calls and specially for big companies it’s very useful that they are able to call each other (or for example the supervisors) directly from the Talkdesk interface.

Besides allowing calls to be answered in the browser directly from the Talkdesk interface, we do integrate Talkdesk with certain applications like Salesforce, Zendesk or Desk.com. By placing a Widget / Keypad inside these systems we allow agents to make calls without leaving the applications they already use: http://cl.ly/image/24211F1P323C.

For the Agent to Agent calls, it is very important that this functionality is included in the "call bar” as we need to be able to call other agents from the Talkdesk interface as well as from Salesforce, Zendesk, and the systems where the widget is present.

Using the background information we provide in the following section and taking into consideration the points mentioned above, please present us with a solution (high-fidelity prototype) that will allow customers to call other agents directly from the Talkdesk interface. 

## Background Information

You'll need to ask for credentials and then use them to login and explore Talkdesk:

*Final note*: If there's anything you don't understand or is ambiguous, open an issue in your repository with the question ;)
