# Devops challenge — elasticsearch

Deploy a 5 node elasticsearch cluster—in a replicable and testable fashion—ready to be used in a production setting (hint: this may include deploying other stuff other than just elasticsearch itself).

A github repository will be provided to you in order for you to deliver all artifacts resulting from this exercise. You are also required to provide a README file detailing your train of thought, steps that you weren't able to implement and the explanation why, and the way to use the artifacts in the repository to deploy a new version of the deployment you provided.

Use any tools you feel comfortable with to achieve this. Preferred ones are a combination of Chef and AWS. Feel free to ask questions or test accounts to deploy your solution as needed.

*Final note*: If there's anything you don't understand or is ambiguous, open an issue in your repository with the question ;)
