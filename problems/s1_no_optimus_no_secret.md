# Security Challenge - No Optimus, No Secret

At Talkdesk we received [a blob of data](/problems/assets/no%20optimus%20no%20secret/everyday.enc) from an anonymous source. With it we've also received a message stating that someone is exfiltrating information from our systems.
We weren't able to understand how it is being done or even if any truth exists in that accusation.

What we ask from you is that you help us in this endeavor and if possible present us with proof that criminal activity is in fact occurring.
Also, always remember of security good practices, people have the bad habit of applying them sparingly...

Good luck!

*Final note*: If there's anything you don't understand or is ambiguous, open an issue in your repository with the question ;)
